# House Price Dataset

## Overview
The **House Price Dataset** contains real estate data, including property details, location information, and sale prices. This dataset can be used for exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and price prediction.

## Dataset Information
- **Total Columns:** 22
- **Dataset Type:** Structured tabular data
- **Possible Use Cases:** Price prediction, trend analysis, feature engineering, and real estate market insights.

| `Month`           | Month of the sale transaction |
| `Day`             | Day of the sale transaction |

## Usage
This dataset is suitable for:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Finding patterns in house prices and their relation to features like size, location, and condition.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicting house prices using regression models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables such as price per square foot or renovation age to improve predictions.
